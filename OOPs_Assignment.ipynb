        "   -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures software around objects, which are self-contained units that bundle data (attributes) and the functions that operate on that data (methods). OOP organizes programs into reusable blueprints called classes that define the structure for creating objects, enabling developers to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, which contribute to more maintainable, scalable, and efficient software, especially for large and complex projects.\n"

For example, you can create a draw_shape() function that works for a Circle, a Square, and a Triangle, as long as all these objects have a draw() method. This avoids code duplication and makes your system more efficient.\n",

        "  - Flexibility and Extensibility:With polymorphism, you can easily extend your system without having to modify existing code. If you add a new class (like Star) that inherits from the same parent and implements the draw() method, your draw_shape() function will automatically work with the new Star object without any changes. This makes your codebase more adaptable to new features and changes."
